# MIDI File Parser
This project is a [MIDI file](https://wiki.ccarh.org/wiki/MIDI_file_parsing_homework) parser I created in my CS 240 course. MIDI files are typically music-related and involve audio devices.

## Project Description
"MIDI files are the sheet music of the 21st century â€“ they tell you the chords and melodies artists wrote for songs and the often even the drum arrangements. MIDI files can contain the inner workings of a complete song." - Beat Lab Academy.

MIDI files end with the ".mid" extension. Here is an example MIDI file to better understand this project and the various methods in the parser.c file.
